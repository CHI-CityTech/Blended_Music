An assortment of the music used within the show created through the usage of FL Studio and EastWest sounds. 
A play on Traditional Javanese Gamelan music but with western themes and Yoruba flavor.
I chose Yoruba due to it being the some of the music I grew up on as a Nigerian. Despite me being from the Edo tribe I have went to church with Yoruba people and am very familiar with the music and subject matter so I thought it would be a beautiful blend and combination of cultures despite me having zero experience when it comes to composing music.
