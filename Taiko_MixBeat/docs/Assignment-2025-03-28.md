## Thematic Discussion Highlights

### Replicating Japanese Musical Traditions

- Discussed understanding the theory behind **Shakuhachi** and **Shamisen** ensembles and the styles they are used within.
- Emphasized documenting the learning process with media links and notes.  
- Highlighted **Taiko** as a model for rhythmic and spatial exploration.

### Accessibility and Cultural Significance

- Compared **Noh music** and **Kabuki** for cultural insight.  
- Noh = stylized, subtle, court tradition.  
- Kabuki = theatrical, dynamic, populist.
- Explored potential fusion: **Taiko + electric guitar** for example (only an example)

- Identified traditional genres to explore:  
  - **Nagauta**, **Juta**, **Minyokuta**, **Haute Shinnai**, **Tokawazu**, **Kiyomo**
- Discussed cross-genre experimentation.

### Music Creation Process

- Eric prefers intuitive creation: "go with the flow."  
- David encouraged structured experimentation before finalizing.
- One mus tfirst become intimate with a particular style before this type of improvisation works.  For these pieces, analysis of allowable patterns etc. are critical to creating a style that feels similar.  
- Suggested possible fusion with Western genres.  This fusion can occur in many differetn parameters:  careful consideraiton is important as these decisions will influence all subsequent activity.
